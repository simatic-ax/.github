### Proposing content changes to individual repositories

Within the SIMATIC AX GitHub community we're following the standard process of forking a repository, in order to receive and integrate changes in our code base.

Please see the [pull request process](/docs/PULL_REQUEST_PROCESS.md) for more detailed information.

### Contributing New Repositories

### Non-Siemens employees
If you want to provide a completely new repository to the community, you will need to follow a special process, similar to internal contributors, because of certain legal and organizational procedures:

- Clearly state the repository’s purpose, scope, and intended use.
- Prepare the contents and ensure they comply with the community guidelines described below.
- Reach out to the [Team of AXion](https://github.com/orgs/simatic-ax/teams/toa-teamofaxion). The administrators will initiate necessary legal checks for your content (OSS, IP, and ECC clearings).
- The admins will support you and perform these mandatory checks since external contributors cannot execute these clearings independently.

Once all clearings are successful, our admins will create the repository within the community, upload the content, and grant the appropriate permissions.

### Siemens employees

In case you are a Siemens employee who likes to propose a new repository for the GitHub community, please the [Siemens contribution process](https://code.siemens.com) for a set of follow along instructions.

> For all inquiries, please get in touch via our [Admin Team](https://github.com/orgs/simatic-ax/teams/toa-teamofaxion).
