# Code Snippets

## Purpose

Code snippets are intended to help users easily paste specific code snippets into their files. We recommend adding the snippets package(s) to your apax.yml devDependencies. More code snippets will be added here over time.

These snippets can be used for:

- including repeatable code sections into your project quickly
- standardizing source code behavior and creation
