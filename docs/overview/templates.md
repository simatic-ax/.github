# Useful templates for project workspaces

## Purpose

Here you'll find an overview of some useful templates for project workspaces you can find in our SIMATIC AX GitHub Community. Each project template contains workflow/project type-specific definitions and scripts, so they don't have to be recreated each time.

More information regarding templates can be found [here](https://console.simatic-ax.siemens.io/docs/apax/templates)

These templates can be used for:

- new GitHub AX community repositories
- base for new user-defined templates
